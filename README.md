Using a programming by demonstration (PBD) paradigm, Crepe enables researchers to collect specific data by simply tapping on the target data on the screen.


## Features

- **Graph Query Technology:** Utilize a custom query language to flexibly and accurately identify and locate target data on UI screens.
- **Low-Code Interface:** Enable researchers to specify what data to collect through simple no-code demonstrations.
- **Low-battery Impact:** Minimize its impact on device battery life, ensuring that data collection can proceed for extended periods without significantly affecting the daily usage of participant devices.
- **Collector Sharing with CollectorID:** Researchers can share the collector with the participants simbly by sharing the collectorID.


## Setup

To use this app, the suggested Android Version is `9.0.0+`. If running for the first time, you need to login into the app with a `Google Account`.

## Privacy Policy

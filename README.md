Crepe is an Android application designed to help academic researchers collect data displayed on mobile screens. It's an app developed by the [SaNDwich Lab](https://toby.li/). Crepe is built on top of the accessibility service provided by Android to collect data on Android app.

Using a programming by demonstration (PBD) paradigm, Crepe enables researchers to collect specific data by simply tapping on the target data on the screen.


## Features

- **Graph Query Technology:** Utilize a custom query language to flexibly and accurately identify and locate target data on UI screens.
- **Low-Code Interface:** Enable researchers to specify what data to collect through simple no-code demonstrations.
- **Low-battery Impact:** Minimize its impact on device battery life, ensuring that data collection can proceed for extended periods without significantly affecting the daily usage of participant devices.
- **Collector Sharing with CollectorID:** Researchers can share the collector with the participants simbly by sharing the collectorID.

## Term Explained


### GraphQuery

GraphQuery is composed of 'Graph' and 'Query'.

In this folder, we create an abstract layer to expand details about current UI Elements. Based on the basic information, we define node, variable and block to form a graph that shows the relationships among these UI elements. This relationships could be represented in spatial, hierarchical and functional structures. In this graph, we also adds some new attributes of the UI Elements 

In addition, we define a set of criteria about how the query could work. This includes:
1. logical expression like `AND`, `OR`, etc.
2. Filtering logic like `ARG_MIN`, `ARG
MAX` and `EXISTS` etc.
3. Relation logic like `HAS_TEXT`, `IS_CLICKABLE` and `RIGHT_OF` etc.
4. Simplest Query with specific relations and entities.
5. Subqueries
6. PlaceholderQuery for the need to dynamically modify the structure of an existing query.

Based on the graph and query part, we could form a UISnapShot that captures a snapshot the current state of the UI Interface. The data structure contains a subject, predicate and object. For example, `Button X has text 'Submit'` or `Image Y is to the right of Text Z`. With this snapshot, we could analyze or interact with the UI programmatically. To be specific, we could use machine language to explain what users perceive or explain(This is the natural language)

### Demonstration

The demonstration is mainly to confirm the data that we want to collect and figure out the reason why the user want to collect this data.

In the demonstration process, the system could generate `GraphQuery` through users' `tap` interaction with the User Interface. When the user tap a text, the system will create a UISnapshot that shows all the attributes and possible relationships regarding the UI Element where the text stands for. After users write a description about their purpose, we ask generative AI to tell which relationships match the purpose. For example, the purpose of tapping the first element in the list(the element name is `Black Coffee`) and tapping the names that contains `Black coffee` is different. The first one could be interpreted as the fact that the user just want to select the top recommended coffee. But the second one could be interpreted as the fact that the user just want to drink black coffee.

## Setup

### For users

To use this app, the suggested Android Version is `9.0.0+`. If running for the first time, you need to login into the app with a `Google Account`.

### For researchers

To build the `apk` file using this repo, there are several steps:

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git`

2. Set Up Development Environment
    * In this step, you need to add a virtual device(`tools->Device Manager->Create Virtual Device`) or connect your own device using usb port
    * You also need to install `HAXM`. Before that, you need to enable `System Configuration->VirtualizationTechnology` in your `Bios` Setup
    * You can modify your SDK location if you want to in `Tools->SDK Manager-> Android SDK Location`

3. Generate a Keystore File

* Open you command line, go to the path where you want to create a binary file that holds a set of keys, then run the following command:

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore your_keystore_name.keystore -alias your_alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

* `your_keystore_name.keystore`: This is the name of the keystore file you want to create.
* `your_alias_name`: This is an alias name for your key, which youâ€™ll use to reference it.
* The `-validity` value is how long (in days) the keys are valid. You can set this as needed.

4. Configuring Signing and Build

* Go to `Build->Generate Signed Bundle / APK`
* Choose `APK` and click `Next`
* Configure key store infomation
    * Key store path: Click the folder icon and locate your keystore file.
    * Key store password: Enter the password for your keystore.
    * Key alias: Enter the alias for your key.
    * Key password: Enter the password for your key.
* Choose the build variant(debug or release)
* Generate the APK
